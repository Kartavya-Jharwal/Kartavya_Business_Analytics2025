# CarbonSeer v2.0 - Design & Functionality Upgrade Complete ✅

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### Phase 1: Sidebar & Navigation ✓
- **Enhanced sidebar styling** with glassmorphism and smooth animations
- **Renamed `Experiment.py` → `Analysis.py`** for better semantic naming
- **Modern navigation components** (navbar, page headers, breadcrumbs)
- Updated all references in app.py and imports

### Phase 2: Splash Screen & Footer ✓
- **Fixed splash screen** to show only once per session (using session_state)
- **Implemented sticky footer** with:

  - Professional glassmorphism design
  - Responsive layout

### Phase 3: Color Palette Transformation ✓
**New Professional Palette:**
- **Orange:** #FBA834 (primary), #E9762B (dark), #FCC266 (light)
- **Blue:** #387ADF (secondary), #333A73 (dark), #50C4ED (light), #D4EBF8 (bg)
- **Fallback:** #F1F0E9 (warm beige background)

Applied to:
- Hero section (orange gradient)
- Main background (warm fallback + light blue)
- Sticky footer accents
- Theme configuration
- All interactive elements

### Phase 4: Technical Fixes ✓
- **Fixed Streamlit config** - Set `enableCORS = true` (was false, conflicted with XSRF)
- **Updated deprecated API** - Changed `st.experimental_rerun()` → `st.rerun()`
- Created `.streamlit/config.toml` with theme colors and server settings
