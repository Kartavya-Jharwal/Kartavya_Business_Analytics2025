## 🎯 Change Summary

**User Request:** Remove Cramér's V effect size from chi-square analysis per professor feedback (over-engineered for undergraduate level)

**Action Taken:** Systematically removed all Cramér's V calculations, interpretations, and references while keeping chi-square test intact

---

## ✂️ Cells Modified

### **Cell #VSC-5b78aceb** (Markdown - Step 7 Header)
**Before:**
```markdown
**Effect Size: Cramér's V**

$$V = \sqrt{\frac{\chi^2}{n \times (k-1)}}$$

Where:
- $n$ = total sample size
- $k$ = smaller of (number of rows, number of columns)
- $V$ ranges from 0 (no association) to 1 (perfect association)

**Interpretation Benchmarks (Cohen, 1988):**
- $V < 0.1$: Negligible effect
- $0.1 \leq V < 0.3$: Small effect
- $0.3 \leq V < 0.5$: Medium effect
- $V \geq 0.5$: Large effect
```

**After:**
```markdown
[REMOVED ENTIRE SECTION]
```

---

### **Cell #VSC-1929d870** (Python - Chi-Square Calculation)
**Before:**
```python
# Effect size: Cramér's V
n = contingency_no_margins.sum().sum()
min_dim = min(contingency_no_margins.shape[0] - 1, contingency_no_margins.shape[1] - 1)
cramers_v = np.sqrt(chi2_stat / (n * min_dim))

print(f"\n📏 EFFECT SIZE:")
print("-" * 80)
print(f"Cramér's V: {cramers_v:.4f}")

# Interpret Cramér's V
if cramers_v < 0.1:
    effect_interpretation = "Negligible"
elif cramers_v < 0.3:
    effect_interpretation = "Small"
elif cramers_v < 0.5:
    effect_interpretation = "Medium"
else:
    effect_interpretation = "Large"

print(f"Effect size interpretation: {effect_interpretation}")
```

**After:**
```python
[REMOVED - No effect size calculation]
```

**Kept:**
- Chi-square statistic
- P-value
- Degrees of freedom
- Critical value
- Observed vs Expected frequencies
- Residuals and standardized residuals

---

### **Cell #VSC-a11e078d** (Python - Alternative Chi-Square)
**Before:**
```python
# Calculate effect size (Cramér's V)
n = contingency_table.sum().sum()
cramers_v = np.sqrt(chi2_stat / (n * (min(contingency_table.shape) - 1)))
print(f"Cramér's V (effect size): {cramers_v:.4f}")
```

**After:**
```python
[REMOVED]
```

---

### **Cell #VSC-36f0bcbe** (Python - Contextual Interpretation)
**Before:**
```python
print("\n📈 STATISTICAL EVIDENCE:")
print("-" * 80)
print(f"χ² = {chi2_stat:.4f}, p < 0.001, Cramér's V = {cramers_v:.3f}")

# ... later ...

print("\n💡 PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE:")
print("-" * 80)
print(
    f"Effect size (Cramér's V = {cramers_v:.3f}) indicates {effect_interpretation.lower()} association"
)

if cramers_v >= 0.3:
    print(
        "This is a SUBSTANTIAL effect - GDP is a meaningful predictor of LEGAL commitments"
    )
elif cramers_v >= 0.1:
    print(
        "This is a MODERATE effect - GDP shows some predictive value for LEGAL commitments"
    )
else:
    print("This is a SMALL effect - GDP has limited predictive value")
```

**After:**
```python
print("\n📈 STATISTICAL EVIDENCE:")
print("-" * 80)
print(f"χ² = {chi2_stat:.4f}, p < 0.001")

# [REMOVED practical significance section based on Cramér's V]
```

### **Cell #VSC-d73588e6** (Markdown - Findings Summary)
**Before:**
```markdown
**Evidence:**
- **Chi-square (χ²):** Highly significant (large deviation from independence)
- **P-value:** < 0.001 (significant)
- **Cramér's V:** Small to medium effect size
```

**After:**
```markdown
**Evidence:**
- **Chi-square (χ²):** Highly significant (large deviation from independence)
- **P-value:** < 0.001 (significant)
```

## ✅ What Remains (Chi-Square Analysis)

### **Statistical Test Components:**
- ✅ Chi-square statistic (χ²)
- ✅ P-value
- ✅ Degrees of freedom
- ✅ Critical value (α = 0.05)
- ✅ Contingency table (observed frequencies)
- ✅ Expected frequencies under H₀
- ✅ Residuals (Observed - Expected)
- ✅ Standardized residuals

### **Decision Making:**
- ✅ P-value approach (p < 0.05 → Reject H₀)
- ✅ Critical value approach (χ² > 5.991 → Reject H₀)
- ✅ Statistical conclusion (association exists)

### **Business Interpretation:**
- ✅ Commitment rates by GDP category
- ✅ Odds ratios (High GDP vs Low GDP)
- ✅ CBAM implications
- ✅ Supply chain recommendations

## 📊 Impact Assessment

### **Statistical Rigor:**
- **Before:** Chi-square + effect size (graduate level)
- **After:** Chi-square only (appropriate for undergrad)
- **Trade-off:** Lost effect size quantification, but simplified analysis

### **Interpretation Quality:**
- **Before:** Nuanced effect size interpretation (small/medium/large)
- **After:** Binary significance testing (significant/not significant)
- **Trade-off:** Less granular, but clearer for foundational course

### **Pedagogical Alignment:**
- **Before:** Included Cohen (1988) effect size benchmarks
- **After:** Focuses on hypothesis testing framework
- **Improvement:** Better aligned with BAN-0200 curriculum

## 🎓 Remaining Complexity (Still Appropriate)

### **Advanced Features Kept (Justified):**
1. **Shapiro-Wilk Tests** ✅ (User requested to keep)
2. **Skewness/Kurtosis** ✅ (User requested to keep)
3. **Spearman Correlation** ✅ (Ordinal analysis supplement)
4. **Commitment Strength (0-5)** ✅ (User requested to keep)
5. **Literature Review** ✅ (User requested to keep)
6. **Odds Ratios** ✅ (Business-relevant metric)
7. **Standardized Residuals** ✅ (Shows contribution to χ²)

### **Why These Remain:**
- User explicitly approved keeping normality/distribution tests
- Spearman correlation uses ordinal data structure (adds value)
- Odds ratios have direct business interpretation (CBAM risk)
- Standardized residuals help understand where association is strongest

## 📝 Next Steps (Phase 2)

Per user's request, still need to:

### **1. Break Large Code Blocks** 🔄
**Current Issue:** Some cells have 50+ lines mixing:
- Data loading
- Statistical tests
- Visualization
- Interpretation

**Solution:** Split into smaller chunks:
```
Cell 1 (Markdown): Explain what we're doing
Cell 2 (Python): Load and prepare data
Cell 3 (Markdown): Interpret descriptive stats
Cell 4 (Python): Run statistical test
Cell 5 (Markdown): Interpret test results
```

### **2. Remove Print Statement Explanations** 🔄
**Current Issue:**
```python
print("🎯 RATIONALE:")
print("While binary classification (legal vs non-legal) is appropriate for CBAM")
print("compliance, the full ordinal structure provides additional insights.")
```

**Solution:** Move to markdown cells above code:
```markdown
### Rationale
While binary classification (legal vs non-legal) is appropriate for CBAM compliance, 
the full ordinal structure provides additional insights.
```

### **3. Simplify Code Cell Content** 🔄
**Goal:** Each code cell should contain ONLY:
- Data manipulation
- Function calls
- Result printing (values only, no explanatory text)
