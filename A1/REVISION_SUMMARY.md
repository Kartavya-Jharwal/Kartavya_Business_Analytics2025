## 📊 What Changed (6 Major Enhancements)

### 1️⃣ Executive Summary (NEW)
- **Location:** Right after title, before imports
- **Content:** 200-word overview with quantitative results
- **Impact:** Immediate context for graders, demonstrates executive communication

### 2️⃣ CBAM/ETS2 Business Justification (NEW)
- **Location:** Before Part 2 analysis
- **Content:** Prominent callout box explaining Net-Zero dataset choice
- **Key Points:** EU CBAM (2026), ETS2 (2027), supply chain carbon risk
- **Impact:** Preempts criticism, shows strategic business thinking

### 3️⃣ Part 1 Structure Reframed
- **Change:** Categorical analysis → PRIMARY, Correlation → SUPPLEMENTARY
- **Rationale:** Aligns with rubric requirements
- **Impact:** Graders see required analysis first, correlation as bonus

### 4️⃣ Scatterplot Visualization (NEW)
- **Location:** After correlation analysis
- **Features:** GDP vs CO₂ with regression line, R² annotation, color-coded categories
- **Impact:** Satisfies rubric visualization requirement

### 5️⃣ Anomaly Analysis Section (NEW)
- **Location:** After visualizations, before Part 1 summary
- **Countries Analyzed:**
  - 🇫🇷 France (-60% emissions): Nuclear policy
  - 🇸🇪 Sweden (-70% emissions): Carbon tax pioneer
  - 🇳🇴 Norway (-50% emissions): Hydro paradox
  - 🇶🇦 Qatar (+270% emissions): Denominator problem
- **Content:** Mechanisms, business lessons, methodological humility
- **Impact:** Raises reflection score from B+ to A

### 6️⃣ Enhanced Code Comments
- **Pattern:** Section headers with purpose/rationale/interpretation
- **Coverage:** All major analysis blocks (correlation, ANOVA, tests)
- **Impact:** Meets "Code Quality & Documentation" criterion

## 🔑 Key Strengths to Highlight in Peer Review

When reviewing others' work, note how this submission:

1. **Satisfies rubric explicitly** (categorical analysis positioned as primary)
2. **Goes beyond requirements** (correlation as supplementary enhancement)
3. **Demonstrates business thinking** (CBAM/ETS2 context, not just academic exercise)
4. **Shows analytical depth** (specific country anomalies with mechanisms)
5. **Communicates clearly** (executive summary, section headers, interpretations)

---

## 📝 Final Notes

### What You Did Right Originally
- Statistical rigor was already graduate-level
- Hypothesis formulation was textbook perfect
- Data sourcing was reputable and transparent
- Writing was clear and professional

### What These Revisions Added
- **Rubric alignment** (graders see what they're looking for)
- **Strategic framing** (business context, not just statistics)
- **Communication polish** (executive summary, prominent justifications)
- **Analytical depth** (anomalies with mechanisms, not generic limitations)

### The Bottom Line
Your technical work was always A-level. These revisions ensure **the grader recognizes that** by making your excellence explicit and aligned with their evaluation framework.

**Ready to submit.** 🚀

Good luck with peer review! Use the same analytical rigor when evaluating others' work—look for both technical correctness AND clear communication.
