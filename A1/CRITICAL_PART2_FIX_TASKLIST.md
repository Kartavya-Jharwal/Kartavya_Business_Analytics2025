# üö® CRITICAL PART 2 DATA STRUCTURE FIX - TASK LIST

## Problem Identified

**CURRENT CODE ASSUMES:** Binary yes/no commitment  
**ACTUAL DATA STRUCTURE:** Ordinal commitment strength with 5 levels + target years

### Actual Dataset Structure:
```
Entity,Code,Year,Status of net-zero carbon emissions targets
Afghanistan,AFG,2050,Proposed / in discussion
Albania,ALB,2030,In policy document
Australia,AUS,2050,In law
Benin,BEN,2000,Achieved (self-declared)
```

**Commitment Strength Hierarchy:**
1. **No target/missing** (lowest)
2. **Proposed / in discussion** (exploratory)
3. **Declaration / pledge** (weak commitment)
4. **In policy document** (moderate commitment)
5. **In law** (strong legal binding)
6. **Achieved (self-declared)** (already done)

**Target Year:** 2000-2070 (indicates urgency/ambition)

---

## üéØ Strategic Decision: Which Approach?

### Option A: Binary with Conservative Threshold ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED**
**Definition:** Only "In law" + "Achieved" = TRUE commitment  
**Rationale:** CBAM context requires LEGAL commitments, not proposals  
**Statistical Test:** Chi-square (same as current)  
**Complexity:** Low - minimal code changes  
**Business Alignment:** Perfect for CBAM risk assessment

### Option B: Ordinal 3-Category
**Categories:** None/Weak (Proposed, Declaration) | Moderate (Policy) | Strong (Law, Achieved)  
**Statistical Test:** Chi-square with 3√ó3 table  
**Complexity:** Medium - more categories, same framework  
**Benefit:** More nuanced analysis

### Option C: Full Ordinal Analysis
**Categories:** All 6 levels preserved  
**Statistical Test:** Ordinal logistic regression or Kruskal-Wallis  
**Complexity:** HIGH - major statistical overhaul  
**Benefit:** Maximum information preservation

### Option D: Add Target Year Analysis
**Additional Variable:** Urgency (2030-2040 = urgent, 2050 = standard, 2060+ = distant)  
**Statistical Test:** Two-way chi-square or ANOVA  
**Complexity:** HIGH - multi-dimensional analysis

---

## ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED APPROACH: Option A (Binary with Conservative Threshold)

**Why:**
1. **CBAM Context:** Only legally binding commitments matter for tariff exemptions
2. **Clarity:** Easy to interpret for business stakeholders
3. **Statistical Rigor:** Chi-square remains appropriate
4. **Minimal Disruption:** Most code can be salvaged
5. **Defensible:** "Proposed" ‚â† "Committed" is logically sound

## üìã COMPREHENSIVE FIX TASK LIST

### ‚úÖ PHASE 1: Variable Creation (CRITICAL)

- [ ] Read net-zero data
- [ ] Print unique status values
- [ ] Count frequency of each status
- [ ] Document in notebook

**Task 1.2:** Create corrected binary commitment variable

      lambda x: 1 if pd.notna(x) and str(x).lower() not in ["nan", "none", "", "no target"] else 0
  )
  ```
- [ ] **NEW CODE (CORRECT):**
  ```python
  # Conservative definition: Only legal commitments count
  legal_commitments = ["In law", "Achieved (self-declared)"]
  merged_nz["Has_Strong_Commitment"] = merged_nz[target_col].apply(
      lambda x: 1 if pd.notna(x) and str(x).strip() in legal_commitments else 0

## üéØ Expected Impact of Fix

### What Will Change:
1. **Commitment Rate Will DECREASE**
   - Old (wrong): ~60-70% of countries "committed" (including proposals)
   - New (correct): ~30-40% with LEGAL commitments
   
2. **Stronger Association with GDP**
   - Legal commitments require institutional capacity
   - Expect HIGHER chi-square statistic (stronger effect)
   
3. **More Conservative Business Recommendations**
   - Clearer CBAM risk stratification
   - Only legally bound countries exempt

### What Will Stay Same:
1. Chi-square test framework ‚úì
2. 3√ó2 contingency table structure ‚úì
3. Overall hypothesis direction (positive association) ‚úì
4. Most interpretation logic ‚úì

---

## üîç Verification Checklist

After fixes, verify:
- [ ] Variable name changed throughout: `Has_NetZero_Target` ‚Üí `Has_Strong_Commitment`
- [ ] Only "In law" and "Achieved (self-declared)" count as committed
- [ ] Contingency table shows lower commitment rates
- [ ] Chi-square test still runs successfully
- [ ] Expected frequencies still ‚â• 5
- [ ] All visualizations updated with new data
- [ ] All interpretations reflect "legally binding" language
- [ ] Executive summary percentages updated
- [ ] CBAM context emphasizes legal commitments

---

## üìù Communication Strategy

### What to Document:
1. **Methodological Note:** "We define commitment conservatively as legally binding targets (enshrined in law or already achieved). Proposals and policy documents, while positive signals, do not provide the regulatory certainty required for CBAM assessment."

2. **Sensitivity Statement:** "If we include policy documents as commitments, the overall rate increases by X%, but the GDP association remains statistically significant (p < 0.05)."

3. **Business Justification:** "For CBAM tariff exemptions, only legally binding commitments are recognized by EU regulators. This analysis reflects operational risk assessment."

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Time:
- **Quick Fix (Binary only):** 2-3 hours
- **Comprehensive (with sensitivity):** 4-6 hours
- **Full Overhaul (ordinal analysis):** 8-12 hours

**RECOMMENDATION:** Start with quick fix (Option A), validate results, then decide if ordinal analysis adds value.
