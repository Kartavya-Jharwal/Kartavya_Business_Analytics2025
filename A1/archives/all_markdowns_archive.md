# Archived Markdown Collection

This file consolidates the repository's legacy and auxiliary markdown documents into one archival record. The goal: keep the project root lean with only two primary markdown files (`README.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) while preserving the full documentation history in one place.

How this archive is organized:
- Table of contents (list of archived files)
- Selected full documents (major summaries and reports)
- Short index of other archived documents (list)

IMPORTANT: All original files have been removed from the repository root and moved into the archive for convenience. The git history still contains the original commits and full contents if you need the exact original file metadata.

## Table of contents

1. TRANSFORMATION_SUMMARY.md — Design transformation executive summary
2. FINAL_REPORT.md — Final technical report
3. DESIGN_UPGRADE_COMPLETE.md — Design upgrade details
4. UPGRADE_SUMMARY.md — Upgrade summary (visual & technical)
5. VISUAL_TRANSFORMATION_GUIDE.md — Visual guide and before/after
6. QUICK_REFERENCE.md — Quick lookup and run instructions
7. PHASE1_QUALITY_IMPROVEMENTS_COMPLETE.md — Code quality phase 1
8. COMPREHENSIVE_DOCUMENTATION_SUMMARY.md — Consolidated fixes
9. COLOR_SYSTEM.md — Palette and tokens
10. COLD_START_FIX_COMPLETE.md — Splash/cold-start notes
