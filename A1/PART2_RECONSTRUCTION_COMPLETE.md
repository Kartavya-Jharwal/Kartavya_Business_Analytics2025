# Part 2 Reconstruction - Complete ✅

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** MAJOR RECONSTRUCTION COMPLETE  
**Assignment:** BAN-0200 Hypothesis Testing (Due: October 24, 2025)

---

## 🎯 Critical Issues Identified & Resolved

### **Problem 1: Graduate-Level Tests Not in Curriculum** ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Issue:**
- Added **Kruskal-Wallis H-test** and **Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test** (advanced non-parametric methods)
- These are **graduate-level statistics** NOT taught in BAN-0200 (Fundamentals of Business Analytics)
- Violated course curriculum constraints
- Risk of grade penalty for using unauthorized methods

**Solution:**
- **DELETED** 5 cells containing these advanced tests:
  - Cell 34: Markdown header "1b. Create Ordinal Commitment Strength Variable"
  - Cell 35: Python code creating ordinal commitment strength (with print explanations)
  - Cell 36: Markdown header "6a. Kruskal-Wallis H-Test"
  - Cell 37: Python code for Kruskal-Wallis test
  - Cell 38: Python code for Jonckheere-Terpstra test
- **REMOVED** references to these tests in methodological justification section
- **UPDATED** Spearman correlation section to remove comparisons to deleted tests

**Impact:** Notebook now aligns with foundational undergraduate curriculum

---

### **Problem 2: Corrupted Markdown Structure** ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Issue:**
- Part 2 explanations buried in Python `print()` statements instead of markdown cells
- Comments and reasoning inside code cells rather than dedicated explanation blocks
- Violates pedagogical best practices (code and explanation should be separate)
- Makes notebook harder to read and understand
- Loss of narrative flow

**Solution:**
- **ADDED** 5 new comprehensive markdown cells:
  1. **Step 2: Data Preparation** (Cell 35) - Explains binary variable creation and CBAM logic
  2. **Step 3: Data Quality Validation** (Cell 37) - Outlines quality checks before testing
  3. **Step 4: EDA - Visual Exploration** (Cell 39) - Explains visualization strategy
  4. **Visual Analysis Interpretation** (Cell 41) - Interprets charts before statistical testing
  5. **Step 7: Calculate Chi-Square** (Cell 44) - Explains formulas and effect size metrics
  6. **Step 8: Statistical Decision** (Cell 46) - Clarifies decision rules
  7. **Step 9: Contextual Interpretation** (Cell 48) - Sets up business implications
  
- **REWROTE** methodological justification (Cell 36) - Removed dual-approach complexity, focused on chi-square

**Impact:** Clear separation of code and narrative, improved readability

---

### **Problem 3: Missing Visualizations** ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Issue:**
- Assignment explicitly requires visualizations for Part 2
- Cell 44 (now Cell 40) contained visualization code BUT:
  - No markdown cell explaining **why** we visualize
  - No markdown cell **interpreting** the visual results
  - Visualizations not contextualized in analysis workflow

**Solution:**
- **ADDED** explanatory markdown cell (Cell 39) before visualizations explaining:
  - Why visualize before formal testing
  - What each of 4 charts shows
  - Expected patterns if H₁ is true
  
- **ADDED** interpretation markdown cell (Cell 41) after visualizations explaining:
  - What patterns are visible in each chart
  - Statistical implications of visual evidence
  - Transition to formal hypothesis testing

**Impact:** Visualizations now properly integrated with clear pedagogical purpose
