### Priority 4 - Interpretation Markdown Cells

#### 15-21. All Interpretation Cells ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS FIX
**Cells to Update:**
- #VSC-5720fcfc: Hypothesis 2 findings
- #VSC-e16feaca: Final synthesis
- #VSC-1c38ca28: Hypothesis comparison
- #VSC-d21f3e29: Statistical limitations
- #VSC-c390f216: Business recommendations
- #VSC-a7e2a2b8: CBAM implications
- #VSC-9beb0840: Future research

**Required Changes:**
- Change all references from "net-zero commitment" to "legally binding commitment"
- Update percentages to reflect conservative definition (will be lower)
- Add clarification that proposals/policy documents don't count

---

### Priority 5 - Executive Summary

**Required Changes:**
- Update commitment rate percentages (will decrease with conservative definition)
- Add clarification about "legally binding" definition
- Update CBAM risk assessment based on legal commitments only

---

## üìä Expected Impact of Fixes

### Quantitative Changes Expected:

**Before (WRONG - counted all statuses):**
```
Overall commitment rate: ~60-70%
Low GDP: ~15-20% committed
Medium GDP: ~40-50% committed  
High GDP: ~70-80% committed
```

**After (CORRECT - legal commitments only):**
```
Overall commitment rate: ~25-35% (LOWER)
Low GDP: ~5-10% legally committed (MUCH LOWER)
Medium GDP: ~15-25% legally committed (LOWER)
High GDP: ~40-60% legally committed (LOWER)
```

**Statistical Impact:**
- Chi-square p-value may DECREASE (stronger significance) because:
  - Legal commitments more concentrated in high GDP countries
  - Clearer separation between categories
  - Effect size (Cram√©r's V) likely to INCREASE

### Qualitative Changes:

**Interpretation Shift:**
- **OLD:** "Most countries have climate commitments"
- **NEW:** "Only economically advanced countries have LEGAL climate commitments"

**Business Implications:**
- **Sharper CBAM risk stratification:** Low/medium GDP countries face tariffs
- **Clearer investment thesis:** Legal commitments = regulatory certainty
- **More conservative supply chain analysis:** Don't count on proposals

## ‚úÖ Verification Before Moving to Next Cells

**Tests to Run:**
1. Check that new variable `Has_Strong_Commitment` exists: ‚úì VERIFIED
2. Verify conservative definition applied correctly: ‚úì VERIFIED
3. Check commitment rates are lower than before: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS TESTING
4. Verify contingency table has correct structure (3√ó2): ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS TESTING
5. Confirm expected frequencies still ‚â• 5: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS TESTING

## üìù Critical Reminders for Remaining Fixes

**Global Find/Replace Pattern:**
- Find: `Has_NetZero_Target`
- Replace: `Has_Strong_Commitment`
- **BUT:** Also update all TEXT references:
  - "net-zero commitment" ‚Üí "legally binding commitment"
  - "committed countries" ‚Üí "legally committed countries"
  - "has commitment" ‚Üí "has legal commitment"

**Key Messaging to Maintain:**
- Only "In law" and "Achieved (self-declared)" count as committed
- Proposals, declarations, and policy documents do NOT count
- This conservative definition aligns with CBAM requirements
- Legal commitments provide regulatory certainty for business planning

---

## üöÄ Estimated Remaining Work

- **Chi-square analysis cells (6-8):** 30 minutes
- **Supplementary tests (9-14):** 45 minutes
- **Interpretation markdown (15-21):** 45 minutes
- **Executive summary (22):** 15 minutes
- **Testing & validation:** 30 minutes

**Total:** ~2-3 hours to complete all remaining fixes

---

## üí° Key Achievement So Far

**We've fixed the fundamental DATA ERROR!**

The analysis now correctly:
‚úÖ Distinguishes between commitment STRENGTH (ordinal) vs presence (binary)
‚úÖ Uses conservative definition appropriate for CBAM regulatory context
‚úÖ Provides transparency about what counts as "committed"
‚úÖ Documents sensitivity to definition choice

**This is now METHODOLOGICALLY SOUND!** üéâ

The remaining fixes are mostly mechanical (variable name changes and text updates).
