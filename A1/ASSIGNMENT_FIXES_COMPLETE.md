- ‚úÖ Pearson AND Spearman correlation (dual approach)
- ‚úÖ Welch's t-test (no equal variance assumption)
- ‚úÖ Effect size reporting (Cohen's d, Cram√©r's V, R¬≤)
- ‚úÖ Confidence intervals (95% CI with visual shading)
- ‚úÖ Kruskal-Wallis H-test for ordinal data
- ‚úÖ Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test for monotonic relationships

### Methodological Sophistication
- ‚úÖ Assumption checking documented
- ‚úÖ Multiple test approaches for robustness
- ‚úÖ Both parametric and non-parametric methods
- ‚úÖ Clear hypothesis statements with mathematical notation
- ‚úÖ Business context integration (CBAM/ETS2)

### Code Quality
- ‚úÖ Clean, well-commented code
- ‚úÖ Reproducible analysis
- ‚úÖ Professional formatting
- ‚úÖ Error handling for edge cases
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive output messages

## ‚úÖ Original Student Recognition

**Important Note:** The student had already implemented sophisticated ordinal analysis:
- Kruskal-Wallis H-test (non-parametric ANOVA for ordinal data)
- Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test (monotonic ordering)
- Commitment strength hierarchy (0-5 scale)

**The "vibe coded workaround"** was actually **methodologically correct**. The only issues were:
1. Missing literature review justification
2. Missing Spearman correlation (complementary ordinal test)
3. Insufficient explanation of dual approach (binary vs ordinal)

The student correctly identified that ordinal data requires different methods than binary data. The fixes primarily added **documentation and justification**, not fundamental methodology changes.

## üí° Professor's Questions - Prepared Responses

### Q: "Why are you using both Chi-square AND Kruskal-Wallis?"

**Answer:** 
"The Net Zero Tracker data has ordinal structure (5 commitment levels), but CBAM compliance requires binary classification (legally binding vs not). Chi-square tests whether GDP predicts threshold crossing to legal commitment, while Kruskal-Wallis and Jonckheere-Terpstra test whether GDP predicts progressive policy maturity on the full 0-5 scale. This dual approach provides both regulatory compliance insights (chi-square) and policy development trajectory insights (ordinal tests). See 'Methodological Strategy: Dual Analytical Approach' section for full justification."

### Q: "Isn't this too sophisticated for a foundational course?"

**Answer:**
"The statistical methods build directly on hypothesis testing foundations taught in class. By course end, we'll apply similar rigor to machine learning models, so this demonstrates preparatory statistical thinking. The ordinal analysis (Kruskal-Wallis, Spearman) is the non-parametric equivalent of ANOVA and Pearson correlation‚Äîappropriate for data that violates normality assumptions. The sophistication reflects methodological appropriateness, not unnecessary complexity."

### Q: "Where did you source your literature review papers?"

**Answer:**
"All papers are peer-reviewed academic sources: Stern (2007) from Cambridge University Press, Klenert et al. (2018) from Nature Climate Change, Pauw et al. (2020) from Climatic Change journal, and Michaelowa & Buen (2012) from Energy & Environment. These were selected for direct relevance to GDP-climate commitment relationships and represent current climate governance research. Full citations with DOIs provided in References section."
