# âœ… CHANGES COMPLETED - October 4, 2025

## Summary of Updates Made to assignment.ipynb

### 1. âœ… Robert Swan Quote Moved to Top

**Previous Location:** End of notebook (after academic integrity statement)

**New Location:** Opening section, immediately after title, before course information table

**Quote:**
> *"The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it."*  
> â€” Robert Swan, Polar Explorer

**Impact:** Sets inspirational tone from the start, engaging readers immediately with the climate action theme.

### 2. âœ… Academic Integrity Statement Updated

**Added Acknowledgment of AI Tools:**

**New Text:**
```
**Tools Used:**
- **Google Colab with Gemini AI:** Used as a code enhancement, debugging, and 
  formatting assistance tool. Gemini helped identify syntax errors, suggest code 
  improvements, and format outputs for better readability. All core analytical 
  logic, hypothesis formulation, statistical interpretations, and written content 
  are original work.
- **Python Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn (as cited in references)

**Academic Honesty Declaration:** The statistical analysis, interpretation of results, 
critical thinking, and conclusions presented in this assignment are entirely my own 
intellectual work. AI assistance was limited to technical code refinement and error 
debugging only.
```

**Impact:** Transparent acknowledgment of tools while clearly delineating original work from AI assistance.

### 3. âœ… CBAM and ETS2 Content Added

**Location:** Business Implications section

**New Content Added:**

#### Regulatory Changes Section Enhanced:
- **EU CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism):** Starting 2026, imposes carbon costs on imports
- **EU ETS2:** New Emissions Trading System launching 2027 for buildings and transport
- Emission standards tightening across sectors
- Supply chain sustainability and reporting requirements

#### Strategic Recommendations Section:

**1. CBAM and ETS2 Preparation (Critical for 2026-2027)**
- Carbon Accounting: Implement robust tracking of embedded emissions
- Supply Chain Mapping: Identify high-carbon suppliers and transition risks
- ETS2 Compliance: Prepare for carbon costs in buildings/transport
- Competitive Positioning: Low-carbon products gain advantage under CBAM

**2. Business Analytics for Carbon Management**
- Data Systems: Deploy analytics to track, report, optimize carbon footprint
- Predictive Modeling: Forecast carbon costs under different policy scenarios
- Supplier Risk Assessment: Use GDP-emissions relationships to identify high-risk suppliers
- Investment Optimization: Portfolio analysis incorporating carbon pricing trajectories

**Impact:** Highly relevant for current business landscape, demonstrates practical application of analysis, positions work within emerging regulatory environment.
