# Basic Streamlit App

This is a basic Streamlit application created using `uv` for dependency management.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Welcome message with user input and metrics
- **Data Analysis**: Sample dataset with filtering capabilities
- **Interactive Charts**: Various chart types with customizable parameters

## Setup and Installation

1. Make sure you have `uv` installed. If not, install it from [https://docs.astral.sh/uv/](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

2. Clone or navigate to this directory

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

## Running the Application

To run the Streamlit app:

```bash
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and you can view the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Static interactive site

This repository now includes a static single-page interactive site built for quick local exploration of the CSV datasets.

To view it locally:

1. From the repository root, start a simple HTTP server so the browser can fetch the CSV files by relative paths:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
```

2. Open your browser to http://localhost:8000/site/

The `site/` folder contains `index.html`, `script.js`, and `styles.css` and uses Plotly to render interactive charts from the CSVs present at the repository root.
