## 🎯 KEY RESULTS TO VERIFY WHEN EXECUTED

### Part 1 (GDP vs CO₂):
Watch for these outputs:
- ✓ Pearson r = [should be positive, ~0.4-0.8]
- ✓ P-value < 0.001 (highly significant)
- ✓ Spearman ρ = [similar to Pearson r]
- ✓ R² = [shows % variance explained]
- ✓ Line chart with 3 colored lines (Low, Medium, High GDP)
- ✓ Shaded confidence intervals around lines

### Part 2 (GDP vs Net-Zero):
Watch for these outputs:
- ✓ Chi-square statistic = [positive number]
- ✓ P-value [check if < 0.05]
- ✓ Cramér's V = [between 0 and 1, effect size]
- ✓ Bar charts showing commitment rates
- ✓ Table with commitment percentages by GDP category

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

**If cells don't execute:**
- Check internet connection (needs to load data from URLs)
- Try: Runtime → Restart runtime
- Re-run: Runtime → Run all

**If visualizations don't show:**
- They should appear automatically
- If not, might be a Colab display issue
- Try downloading and re-uploading notebook

**If you see errors:**
- Check which cell has the error
- Most common: Data loading issues (check internet)
- Library import issues (restart runtime)

**If outputs are missing:**
- Must run ALL cells from top to bottom
- Don't skip cells
- Wait for each to complete before moving to next
